# PicoTrainerHardwareHack
Replace hardware to control steppermotor and read sensors on a trainer. 
Using a raspberry pi pico w to replace the electronic controlling device on a bicycle trainer.

Use vscode and clone repo. Download Raspberry pi pico project addon and use to compile and flash.

## Done
Currently the steppermotor from the trainer works using a drv8226 steppermotor driver with a 12v supply.

## TODO
- Connect sensors and code.
- Implement initialization sequence for motor calibration.
- Set maximum allowed rotations.
- Web Interface
- Add electrical schematic later.
